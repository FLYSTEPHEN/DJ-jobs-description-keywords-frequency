 Welcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring! Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019. The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects. The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status. About the position At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.  Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.  Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.  This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.  Responsibilities Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.  Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup’s Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.  You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.  

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won’t be many people who have done it before. So don’t worry if you haven’t done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are: You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.  You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist. You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change. You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline. You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious. You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.  You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed. You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we’ll all be learning how to do it together. Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.  


NOTES:

				Employer will assist with relocation costs.Additional Salary Information: We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is seeking Investigative Data Journalists to collect and analyze data showing the impacts of technology on society, have strong news judgement and can see stories in a dataset. This position reports to the Managing Editor.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

Investigations are the heart of what we do. Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data — through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection — to test our theories.

Investigative journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Data Journalists and Investigative Reporters work closely together on stories, and they work with Graphics Editors to help visually explain their findings.

The Markup's investigative data journalists are skilled at working with large and messy datasets, scraping websites, running statistics, finding outside experts and sources, and most importantly knowing what is a story and isn't a story. They are proud of the clean code they write, the statistical tests they run, and can clearly communicate their findings. In short, they produce the facts we rely on for our investigations.

----------------
Responsibilities
----------------

On large investigations you will be responsible for writing methodologies that explain your work, and helping to write the main feature. You care about the quality of your work, so your code is clean, your analysis repeatable, and your prose is clear.

You are crafty. You have a bunch of story ideas, and are on the lookout for more. You know where to gather data, how to collect it, and importantly what to collect.

You are accurate. You won't begin to analyze a dataset until you are certain it is free of errors.

You are an explorer. You visualize the data first before running statistical tests, so you can see where a story might be.

You are collaborative. You work well on teams, and know that holding the powerful to account is what matters.

You know what you don't know. You don't hesitate to pick up the phone to ask questions, find outside statistical help for analysis, can get academics and researchers to review your findings before publication and generally enjoy learning new things.

You value clarity. You know a simple analysis with clear findings is better than a complicated one done with fancy and sophisticated techniques.

You are open and transparent. The Markup shares the data and code behind our investigations, so the Investigative Data Journalist writes code with a reader in mind. And you can write prose precise enough for a technical reader, but approachable for a general audience.

You are experienced. You've worked on data driven stories and know what it takes to develop and execute a data driven story. .

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics to protect our work and our sources.

------
Skills
------

You should be comfortable in at least a couple of programming languages, and know which one to use for each task. At The Markup, we use Node.js for scraping, python or ruby for data cleaning and parsing, PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch databases for storage, and R for analysis. We've also used a bit of Rust, so you can use newer or esoteric programming languages if they fit the task. Just know that if you do, you'll be the one responsible for maintaining it. You don't need to know all of these languages and tools, but having knowledge of a few of them is a definite plus.

You should be comfortable on the command line: sometimes a story is just a grep away. The same goes for spreadsheet software like Excel: sometimes you'll find a story in a single cell.

You don't need to be a stats expert, but you should be stats curious. You should be conversant in basic statistics and analysis, and have a commitment to learning on the job.

We're looking for someone who has a strong sense of the limits of his/her own knowledge, so that when you encounter a new problem you ask first: whether that is meeting with an academic, asking questions internally, doing open source research, reading complicated academic papers, filing a FOIA request, or picking up the phone to call a source.

There isn't a template for this job, you might come from a graphics desk, a data desk or have worked outside of journalism. The only thing we ask for is that you have a bachelor's degree and a few years of relevant experience.

We are building an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-centered approach is a core value for our team.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We'll also provide a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $95,000, and will be established based on the candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please use the form below to submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

53,Investigative Reporter,The Markup,"New York, NY",2018-11-10 12:29:53,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c9d0d34abce26648,NaN,indeed,"$95,000 a yearWelcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is looking for Investigative Reporters who are newer to the field but have demonstrated investigative and data skills.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, is comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and can write compelling articles based on our findings.

Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection— to test our theories.

Investigative Reporters will work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.

This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.

------------------------
Responsibilities include
------------------------

Investigations are the heart of The Markup's work. Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.

Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.

----------------------
Qualifications include
----------------------

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won't be many people who have done it before. Don't worry if you haven't done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills and experience we are looking for include:

You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.

You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of several years of experience generating enterprising news articles.

You know how to dive deep. You have worked on investigations (even if your previous employer didn't give you much time to do them!).

You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent several years writing news articles on a deadline.

You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious.

You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.

You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn).

You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we'll all be learning how to do it together.

Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $95,000, and will be established based on the successful candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please fill out the form below and submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

Location: DC, US
Company: Associated Press
The Associated Press is the essential global news network, delivering fast, unbiased news from every corner of the world to all media platforms and formats. Founded in 1846, AP today is the largest and most trusted source of independent news and information. On any given day more than half the world's population sees news from AP.
The Associated Press is offering a paid 12-week full-time summer data journalism internship based in Washington, DC in 2019.
We are a small team of enterprising developer-journalists distributed across the U.S., and together we work on a variety of data-rich news projects – from drilling into data sets for AP investigations, to developing engaging news apps for big stories such as the U.S. elections, to building newsroom tools that enhance our beat and breaking-news reporting.
We are seeking new ways to tell stories, both in words and in pixels, and our data journalist intern will work closely with graphic artists, designers, video journalists, text reporters and editors to find the story in the data and bring it to life across platforms.
Based on experience and current skill set, the intern will be assigned to either the news applications developers team or the data analysts team. A solid foundation, either in solving problems with code or seeking insight in data, will be key to quickly contributing to either team.
The ability to effectively collaborate, both with other data journalists on the team and with reporters and editors around the AP, along with intellectual curiosity and initiative are essential to be successful in this role. In addition, the intern must be comfortable interacting with a diverse group of co-workers and interview subjects.
The intern will be expected to keep up-to-date with news in the city or region and its relevance to national and international.
Training in all formats will include journalism ethics. Interns must become familiar with - and abide by - the AP’s statement of values and principles governing ethics.

Must be able to show proof of legal authorization to participate in a 12-week internship in the U.S. prior to the start of the internship.
Effective data analysis and reporting skills with a track record of developing strong story ideas from data.
Must be familiar with HTML and web standards.
Relevant experience and training in text is required as well as a secondary visual format such as video, photos or interactive/graphics, data visualizations and 3D animations.
Good general knowledge of national and international affairs.
Must have demonstrated proficiency speaking and writing in the English language.
Good writing skills, the ability to recognize grammatical and factual errors and knowledgeable of AP Style.
A prior journalism internship or experience in media.

Do your watchdog senses come alive at the thought of covering a collective government agency with a pattern of officials who've been convicted of felony crimes against the taxpayer?

Would you love to sink your teeth into the fiscal management, or mismanagement, of a $250 million annual budget?

Do you strive to be both first and best in beat coverage?

If so, you're the reporter we're looking for to cover the government and politics of one of Indiana's largest counties.

Our market is located on the bustling south shores of Lake Michigan and within the footprint of suburban Chicago.

In recent years, we've seen a Lake County sheriff convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for preferential private contracts, an elected surveyor who stole from taxpayers and then attempted to destroy the federal evidence and a township trustee convicted of shaking down her government employees for campaign contributions.

Since the mid 1980s, Lake County government has been a revolving door for public corruption cases and federal indictments and convictions.

Our new Lake County government reporter will thrive on jumping into this environment, cultivating and developing sources and rabidly pursuing daily stories and investigations that hold public officials accountable.

The reporter will be equally comfortable weeding through government meetings and processes and cultivating sources to find the stories most socially and financially relevant to our readers. The reporter will also appreciate and cultivate an understanding of the politics and players behind the processes in a county of nearly half a million people.

The Times seeks a veteran journalist, preferably with at least three years of experience working as a beat reporter of a daily newspaper or equivalent media company.

Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider reaching more than one billion people every day. Reuters provides trusted business, financial, national, and international news to professionals via Thomson Reuters desktops, the world's media organizations, and directly to consumers at Reuters.com.

Reuters is seeking a journalist to cover Wall Street banks and serve as a team leader overseeing our coverage of the industry as it moves from a period of restructuring and regulation to a time when business is booming again. Tax reforms engineered by the Trump administration have boosted the bottom line and spurred a spate of megadeals. Meanwhile, trading – once left for dead – has been buoyed by rising interest rates and global economic growth. Other areas like wealth management and asset management are flourishing as banks rely more on technology to keep costs contained.

However, boom times can come with excesses: more risk-taking, questionable products, bigger pay packages and lax oversight. The successful applicant will demonstrate a knack for conceptualizing and delivering stories that explain what’s happening inside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other large financial institutions, and how their actions affect clients, investors, taxpayers and consumers. The team leader would also collaborate with colleagues covering other banks and M&A to break news and drive deeper stories.

Responsibilities:
Pursue ambitious stories, including investigations, about Wall Street banks and their top executives
Break and handle major news about Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
Develop sources across the broader industry, including investment bankers and traders at other big banks
Collaborate with colleagues throughout the Americas, and counterparts in Asia and EMEA, to tell global stories
Be familiar with multiple story-telling platforms including photos, video, text and social media
Requirements:
At least five years’ experience covering financial services firms or corporations
Proven track record of delivering scoops and insightful, agenda-setting stories
Ability to generate and articulate ideas to drive the file forward in original ways
Ability to partner well with different teams, across news bureaus and beats
An interest in editing stories and developing leadership skills
At Thomson Reuters, we believe what we do matters. We are passionate about our work, inspired by the impact it has on our business and our customers. As a team, we believe in winning as one - collaborating to reach shared goals, and developing through challenging and meaningful experiences. With more than 45,000 employees in more than 100 countries, we work flexibly across boundaries and realize innovations that help shape industries around the world. Making this happen is a dynamic, evolving process, and we count on each employee to be a catalyst in driving our performance - and their own.

As a global business, we rely on diversity of culture and thought to deliver on our goals. To ensure we can do that, we seek talented, qualified employees in all our operations around the world regardless of race, color, sex/gender, including pregnancy, gender identity and expression, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, citizen status, veteran status, or any other protected classification under country or local law. Thomson Reuters is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer providing a drug-free workplace.

This reporter will be a self-starter who explores news and trends in cruising, air travel, hotels and attractions as they relate to the South Florida market.
S/he breaks news related to local companies and local interests, with an emphasis on stories that affect consumers. On this fast-paced beat, this requires staying abreast of developments by monitoring releases, social media and Google alerts, and posting online quickly to capitalize on digital traffic.
The ability to develop balanced working relationship and sources both within and outside major companies is essential. Through sources, local companies, trade organizations, data and government reports, this reporter also identifies trends relevant to local workers and employers, and examines those in enterprise stories that delve beneath the surface and beyond the predictable.
Among the questions s/he will ask:
What new and/or changing consumer offerings are available to South Floridians in terms of cruising, hotels, attractions and flights? How do those fit within a broader context of travel offerings? How might they affect the local economy or tourism industry?
How do hotels, cruise lines, airlines and attractions positively and negatively impact local wages, jobs and economy?
What conditions, government policies and practices affect worker and guest safety and comfort?
This beat requires a demonstrated commitment to fairness and accuracy, in fact and in tone, and a strong grounding in journalism ethics. And like all journalists at the Herald, this reporter must demonstrate the desire and skills to build audience loyalty, engagement and growth around compelling public service journalism.
This reporter is expected to not only have the ability to build sources and ferret out facts, but frame, write, produce and promote a story via search and social media to ensure that it reaches and resonates with our readers.
The successful candidate must show competency with analyzing data and working with social media tools like CrowdTangle in prospecting for stories.
Essential qualities include flexibility and a demonstrated commitment to constantly adapting to the ever-evolving ways in which readers seek out and interact with journalism. Like all reporters at the Miami Herald, this one will regularly engage with her/his editor to evaluate stories based on audience and mission to determine what is, and isn’t, worth pursuing.
 On audience:
Who cares about this (or who should)?
Is this a big enough group to make the idea worth pursuing the way it is framed?
Is there a way to extend/expand interest in this subject or information to make the group big enough?
If the group is small, is it influential enough to allow the story to have significant impact?
On mission:
Will the story break news that holds leaders or institutions accountable?
Will the story break news that makes a concrete difference in the community?
Will the story tell readers how something will directly affect their lives or the lives of their families or friends?
Will the story use extraordinary, revelatory story-telling to help readers understand a consequential societal issue in new ways?
Will the story (or sometimes a series of quick hits in the cases of breaking news) attract an extraordinary amount of readership or engagement because it is of great interest and/or value to our readers for other reasons?
Pluses include familiarity with the local region, personal or professional travel and/or cruise experience, data-reporting skills and Spanish-language skills.
This position reports to Business Editor Jane Wooldridge.
Minimum requirements:
Strong writing and reporting skills and excellent news judgment
Unwavering commitment to accurate, ethical journalism
Demonstrated ability to use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to reach audiences
Fluency in the science of readership and engagement, including an understanding of how to use analytics
A demonstrated ability to tell stories using a variety of tools and platforms, including photos and video
A demonstrated ability to learn new skills and technologies, including emerging storytelling tools and platforms

The Atlantic Council is proud to announce the 2018 Korea Journalist Fellowship Program. In partnership with the Korea Foundation, the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security will host the inaugural class of Fellows in Fall 2018. The Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellowship is a unique opportunity for early/mid-career US-based journalists working in US media to develop a deeper knowledge of the most critical economic and security issues on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific more broadly. By engaging with the next generation of thinkers and policy shapers in Seoul and by working with leading experts in Washington, DC, Fellows will gain a better understanding of current attitudes and shifting perceptions that will affect the US-ROK relationship in years to come. Working with seasoned professionals in South Korea and the United States, Fellows will have the opportunity to broaden their professional portfolios while building lasting ties with their counterparts in Korea and contribute to the Atlantic Council’s ongoing mission of upholding the rules-based international order through engagement, dialogue, and fostering a Trans-Atlantic-Pacific community.


Structure:


The Fellowship program works to increase understanding between the Republic of Korea and the United States. The program will host eight to ten journalists interested in learning more about the Republic of Korea. The Fellowship will begin in fall 2018 and will include three private roundtables in Washington, DC as well as a trip to South Korea. The reception to launch this journalist fellowship will be held on November 1, 2018, and the journalists for the 2018 Class will be selected by the end of November. The Atlantic Council plans to host two roundtables prior to the delegation trip to Seoul, which is tentatively scheduled to happen sometime between December and February. The delegation will meet with high-level government officials and experts in South Korea. A final wrap-up roundtable will occur after the trip. Contingent on their selection as Fellows, journalists will commit to attending all three roundtables and joining the delegation on the ground in Seoul. Fellows should also be prepared to research at least one longer story during the program, and to publish at least one article/broadcast piece after the fellowship, though they will retain full editorial control of said piece. The Fellowship will cover travel, lodging, meals, and transportation for the trip to Seoul. Fellows who work outside of Washington, DC will be responsible for covering their own travel costs to Washington, DC for the private roundtables.


The roundtables will feature a panel of leading experts, academics, and government officials with experience working on economic and security issues in the Asia-Pacific.

Fellows will be expected to stay up-to-date on any developments pertinent to US-ROK relations and to actively participate during the roundtable discussions.


2018 Program – A Way Forward for the Peaceful and Denuclearized Korean Peninsula


2018 has been a historic year for trilateral relations between the United States, Republic of Korea, and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and despite all the developments that have happened thus far, the coming months promise to be equally momentous. As the three countries work toward a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula based on the agreements laid out in the Panmunjom Declaration, the Singapore Summit, and the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, journalists and the media will play a key role in ensuring that both policymakers and the general public are well-informed and share a deep understanding of the process as it develops. As such, the inaugural class of Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellows will be provided with opportunities during their fellowship to meet with senior officials, seasoned journalists, and opinion leaders, enabling the Fellows to contribute to the ongoing dialogue taking place both on and about the future of the Korean Peninsula.

This course teaches journalists advanced techniques for effectively and safely reporting on sensitive, difficult and potentially dangerous subjects. We will approach the enterprise of reporting from the standpoint of an intelligence officer, borrowing the best tradecraft that spies, federal agents, police officers, and analysts use to find sources, evaluate their credibility, elicit information from them, analyze that information, and protect the agents of information from legal (and perhaps) physical jeopardy. We will re-reverse engineer the tactics, techniques and procedures that are used against journalists with the aim of protecting and hardening the reporting process itself.

We will identify threats to the physical safety and welfare (online and offline) of journalists, threats to the security of their reporting and their communications, and threats to sources, and we will work on a set of best practices to defend and mitigate these threats.

We will practice real-world scenarios, including counter-surveillance detection, source meetings, reporting from the scenes of active emergencies, and basic situational awareness. We’ll use case studies, interview subject matter experts, and experiment with new technology.

By the end of the course, students will be expected to think strategically and creatively about the security of themselves, their sources, their publications and their reporting teammates.

Requirements for consideration include a B.A., B.S., M.S., or an M.A. degree in a related field. Previous teaching experience is desirable. For some courses, outstanding professional experience may be substituted for academic credentials.

The instructor for this class must have at least ten years of experience as a sworn agent of a federal law enforcement agency, or as an operations officer or analyst with an intelligence agency; direct experience dealing with the press in that capacity is preferred, as is a demonstrated commitment to the first principles of journalism. A knowledge of basic reporting practices, investigatory tradecraft, cyber security issues and national security law would be a plus.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is among the nation’s leading institutions devoted to the study of communication, journalism and public relations. With an enrollment of 2,400 undergraduate and graduate students, USC Annenberg scholars, both students and faculty, are defining these fields for the 21st century and beyond.
