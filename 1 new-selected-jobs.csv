We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.

Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.

Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.

This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.

Responsibilities
----------------

Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.

Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.

Skills
------

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won't be many people who have done it before. So don't worry if you haven't done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are:

You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.

You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist.

You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change.

You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline.

You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious.

You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.

You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed.

You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we'll all be learning how to do it together.

Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.

We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

------------------
About the position
------------------

Investigations are the heart of what we do. Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data — through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection — to test our theories.

Investigative journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Data Journalists and Investigative Reporters work closely together on stories, and they work with Graphics Editors to help visually explain their findings.

The Markup's investigative data journalists are skilled at working with large and messy datasets, scraping websites, running statistics, finding outside experts and sources, and most importantly knowing what is a story and isn't a story. They are proud of the clean code they write, the statistical tests they run, and can clearly communicate their findings. In short, they produce the facts we rely on for our investigations.

----------------
Responsibilities
----------------

On large investigations you will be responsible for writing methodologies that explain your work, and helping to write the main feature. You care about the quality of your work, so your code is clean, your analysis repeatable, and your prose is clear.

You are crafty. You have a bunch of story ideas, and are on the lookout for more. You know where to gather data, how to collect it, and importantly what to collect.

You are accurate. You won't begin to analyze a dataset until you are certain it is free of errors.

You are an explorer. You visualize the data first before running statistical tests, so you can see where a story might be.

You are collaborative. You work well on teams, and know that holding the powerful to account is what matters.

You know what you don't know. You don't hesitate to pick up the phone to ask questions, find outside statistical help for analysis, can get academics and researchers to review your findings before publication and generally enjoy learning new things.

You value clarity. You know a simple analysis with clear findings is better than a complicated one done with fancy and sophisticated techniques.

You are open and transparent. The Markup shares the data and code behind our investigations, so the Investigative Data Journalist writes code with a reader in mind. And you can write prose precise enough for a technical reader, but approachable for a general audience.

You are experienced. You've worked on data driven stories and know what it takes to develop and execute a data driven story. .

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics to protect our work and our sources.

------
Skills
------

You should be comfortable in at least a couple of programming languages, and know which one to use for each task. At The Markup, we use Node.js for scraping, python or ruby for data cleaning and parsing, PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch databases for storage, and R for analysis. We've also used a bit of Rust, so you can use newer or esoteric programming languages if they fit the task. Just know that if you do, you'll be the one responsible for maintaining it. You don't need to know all of these languages and tools, but having knowledge of a few of them is a definite plus.

You should be comfortable on the command line: sometimes a story is just a grep away. The same goes for spreadsheet software like Excel: sometimes you'll find a story in a single cell.

You don't need to be a stats expert, but you should be stats curious. You should be conversant in basic statistics and analysis, and have a commitment to learning on the job.

We're looking for someone who has a strong sense of the limits of his/her own knowledge, so that when you encounter a new problem you ask first: whether that is meeting with an academic, asking questions internally, doing open source research, reading complicated academic papers, filing a FOIA request, or picking up the phone to call a source.

There isn't a template for this job, you might come from a graphics desk, a data desk or have worked outside of journalism. The only thing we ask for is that you have a bachelor's degree and a few years of relevant experience.

We are building an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-centered approach is a core value for our team.

Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform is delighting customers, and we’re looking for a Senior Data Journalist with a strong sense of ownership to join our Seattle team.
You’ll start from a great foundation. We have a powerful brand, exceptional PR, and lots of great content. Best of all, Textio’s vast language data set allows our platform to discover fascinating narratives, and we love sharing them. All told, the Textio blog got hundreds of thousands of visitors last year. Our readership is executive, global, and growing fast. As more and more leaders realize that augmented writing is going to define enterprise technology over the next decade, there is a voracious appetite for data narratives about the way people are writing and talking.

If you’re a data-minded language person with a penchant for storytelling, there is no better content leadership job in the industry. (We know; we’ve read them all!)
What you'll be doing:
Plan, write, and collaborate on the narratives we tell, including building a rich, detailed, long-form writing discipline.
Own and create content for our Word Nerd blog from end to end, and tackle writing copy across multiple mediums.
Work with language data sets and turn data insights into compelling narratives.
Interview customers, industry leaders, and teammates across disciplines and tell their stories.
Cultivate a community of writers at Textio and among our customers, edit their work, and help them bring out their best work. Last year, more than half our company wrote for our blog.
Partner with our marketing team on brand-building opportunities and challenges. How can we maximize our social media influence? Make our emails land? Spread the word about augmented writing?
We’d love to hear from you if:
You’ve read our blog at https://textio.ai, and you love this kind of writing.
You know how to tell data stories for real people; your work speaks not only to data scientists and linguists, but to anyone.
You understand that the best data narratives are funny, fascinating, or both.
You have a background in linguistics, psychology, data journalism, or another social science, and/or you know how to use math to understand how language works and explain it to people.
You know how to make a story last across channels (social media, webinar, email marketing, etc.) and bring a testing mentality help us improve. You’re eager to prove that you can innovate by trying new tactics.
You are a superb communicator verbally and in writing—Textio stands for editorial quality, and you do too.
You ask smart questions and are an exceptional listener who can find the gem in a customer interview.
You understand that sometimes a great data visualization is worth a thousand words.
You are a disciplined self-starter who has the ability to juggle multiple, demanding initiatives concurrently.

Collaborate effectively with a variety of colleagues inside and outside of Cruise.
Juggle multiple projects on fast-moving schedules with competing deadlines.

10+ years as a journalist, writer, or editor.
Exceptional writing, editing, and communication skills.
Expertise in AP Style.
Experience writing content that reflects an established voice and tone guidelines.
Strong collaborator who thrives in fast-paced environments.
Self-starter with excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to drive content projects from start to finish.
A superb writer and storyteller who can distill complex ideas into simple and compelling messages, and articulate not just what's happening but why it matters.

The Orlando Sentinel is looking for a leader for our newly expanded politics team.

As the senior content manager for politics, you will work closely with two other multimedia political journalists (including one in Tallahassee) and the whole newsroom to set the agenda for digitally focused coverage of local, state and national politics. This is not simply a management job – the person must be a top-notch journalist in the field and a leader in the office. The ideal candidate will attack news throughout the day and week, always looking for fresh angles and new ideas that will drive audience to OrlandoSentinel.com with spot and in-depth coverage.
Depending on the day, you will find yourself writing, shooting or appearing in videos, analyzing a database, working on enterprise, or assigning and editing others on the team. The person must be comfortable using metrics to inform coverage, but remain intuitive enough to make creative decisions that anticipate what our readers want. Do we really have to say the person should understand how to engage audience on social media – to see its power and its limitations? This politics team leader also will help us build a stable of bloggers whose personal brands draw loyal readers through active posting online, using all available tools at their disposal (social media, newsletters, video, appearances, etc).

"Adjunct Instructor, Spies Like Us: Operational Security and Tradecraft for Journalists",USC,"Los Angeles, CA",2018-10-27 17:39:38,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=d3c35cd2f024b644,nan,indeed,"The Annenberg School of Journalism at the University of Southern California seeks a highly qualified adjunct instructor to teach JOUR 499 Spies Like Us: Operational Security and Tradecraft for Journalists.

This course teaches journalists advanced techniques for effectively and safely reporting on sensitive, difficult and potentially dangerous subjects. We will approach the enterprise of reporting from the standpoint of an intelligence officer, borrowing the best tradecraft that spies, federal agents, police officers, and analysts use to find sources, evaluate their credibility, elicit information from them, analyze that information, and protect the agents of information from legal (and perhaps) physical jeopardy. We will re-reverse engineer the tactics, techniques and procedures that are used against journalists with the aim of protecting and hardening the reporting process itself.

We will identify threats to the physical safety and welfare (online and offline) of journalists, threats to the security of their reporting and their communications, and threats to sources, and we will work on a set of best practices to defend and mitigate these threats.

We will practice real-world scenarios, including counter-surveillance detection, source meetings, reporting from the scenes of active emergencies, and basic situational awareness. We’ll use case studies, interview subject matter experts, and experiment with new technology.

By the end of the course, students will be expected to think strategically and creatively about the security of themselves, their sources, their publications and their reporting teammates.

Requirements for consideration include a B.A., B.S., M.S., or an M.A. degree in a related field. Previous teaching experience is desirable. For some courses, outstanding professional experience may be substituted for academic credentials.

The instructor for this class must have at least ten years of experience as a sworn agent of a federal law enforcement agency, or as an operations officer or analyst with an intelligence agency; direct experience dealing with the press in that capacity is preferred, as is a demonstrated commitment to the first principles of journalism. A knowledge of basic reporting practices, investigatory tradecraft, cyber security issues and national security law would be a plus.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is among the nation’s leading institutions devoted to the study of communication, journalism and public relations. With an enrollment of 2,400 undergraduate and graduate students, USC Annenberg scholars, both students and faculty, are defining these fields for the 21st century and beyond.

2018 Atlantic Council-Korea Foundation Journalist Fellowship Program,Atlantic Council,"Washington, DC",2018-10-18 17:38:31,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=dba88d9899f82642,nan,indeed,"About


The Atlantic Council is proud to announce the 2018 Korea Journalist Fellowship Program. In partnership with the Korea Foundation, the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security will host the inaugural class of Fellows in Fall 2018. The Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellowship is a unique opportunity for early/mid-career US-based journalists working in US media to develop a deeper knowledge of the most critical economic and security issues on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific more broadly. By engaging with the next generation of thinkers and policy shapers in Seoul and by working with leading experts in Washington, DC, Fellows will gain a better understanding of current attitudes and shifting perceptions that will affect the US-ROK relationship in years to come. Working with seasoned professionals in South Korea and the United States, Fellows will have the opportunity to broaden their professional portfolios while building lasting ties with their counterparts in Korea and contribute to the Atlantic Council’s ongoing mission of upholding the rules-based international order through engagement, dialogue, and fostering a Trans-Atlantic-Pacific community.


Structure:


The Fellowship program works to increase understanding between the Republic of Korea and the United States. The program will host eight to ten journalists interested in learning more about the Republic of Korea. The Fellowship will begin in fall 2018 and will include three private roundtables in Washington, DC as well as a trip to South Korea. The reception to launch this journalist fellowship will be held on November 1, 2018, and the journalists for the 2018 Class will be selected by the end of November. The Atlantic Council plans to host two roundtables prior to the delegation trip to Seoul, which is tentatively scheduled to happen sometime between December and February. The delegation will meet with high-level government officials and experts in South Korea. A final wrap-up roundtable will occur after the trip. Contingent on their selection as Fellows, journalists will commit to attending all three roundtables and joining the delegation on the ground in Seoul. Fellows should also be prepared to research at least one longer story during the program, and to publish at least one article/broadcast piece after the fellowship, though they will retain full editorial control of said piece. The Fellowship will cover travel, lodging, meals, and transportation for the trip to Seoul. Fellows who work outside of Washington, DC will be responsible for covering their own travel costs to Washington, DC for the private roundtables.


The roundtables will feature a panel of leading experts, academics, and government officials with experience working on economic and security issues in the Asia-Pacific. The roundtables will be an opportunity for Fellows to learn more about significant issues affecting the Korean peninsula, giving them an opportunity to benefit from the expertise of career foreign policy experts before the trip to Seoul. Fellows will be expected to stay up-to-date on any developments pertinent to US-ROK relations and to actively participate during the roundtable discussions.


2018 Program – A Way Forward for the Peaceful and Denuclearized Korean Peninsula


2018 has been a historic year for trilateral relations between the United States, Republic of Korea, and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and despite all the developments that have happened thus far, the coming months promise to be equally momentous. As the three countries work toward a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula based on the agreements laid out in the Panmunjom Declaration, the Singapore Summit, and the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, journalists and the media will play a key role in ensuring that both policymakers and the general public are well-informed and share a deep understanding of the process as it develops. As such, the inaugural class of Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellows will be provided with opportunities during their fellowship to meet with senior officials, seasoned journalists, and opinion leaders, enabling the Fellows to contribute to the ongoing dialogue taking place both on and about the future of the Korean Peninsula.

In other words, do great work on a topic dear to our history and our mission. The editor needs a killer instinct and a quiver full of skills. She or he must be a confident leader with experience handling complex, long-form stories and managing a team of high-octane journalists. We also need a creative editor able to refine and perfect our traditional means of storytelling, and to imagine new ways to tell stories. The Enterprise team works in a lot of formats: narrative, investigative, explanatory, visual. The editor must be equally at home with the penetrating investigation, the illuminating profile and the data-rich exploration. Do we want someone who knows a lot about finance? That would be ideal, but we’ll carefully consider applicants who can do this kind of work but whose background is in another subject matter. The position reports to Financial Editor Charles Forelle and is based in New York.

The Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho, is seeking an enterprise editor in charge of our Big Story section, a four-page spread in every Sunday edition and special online presentation focusing on watchdog reporting, investigative journalism and top-notch storytelling.

Recent story examples include piecing together a string of pharmacy robberies that shed light on the nation’s opioid crisis, a three-part story on problems in Idaho’s foster care system, a multi-part project on the growing Hispanic population of a nearby city, a yearlong series following a refugee family who landed in Twin Falls the day the state’s governor announced he supported halting refugee arrivals, a package on a creative writing class in prison and a piece on Idaho’s dire rural doctor shortage.

You’ll work one-on-one with reporters and photographers in developing project ideas weeks or months in advance, methodically edit stories and guide the whole package through the design process.

Wall Street Banks Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist),Thomson Reuters,"New York, NY 10036",# an unknown date more than 30 days ago,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=2a5ab8f5e8ba65d2,nan,indeed,"Job Description
Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider reaching more than one billion people every day. Reuters provides trusted business, financial, national, and international news to professionals via Thomson Reuters desktops, the world's media organizations, and directly to consumers at Reuters.com.

Reuters is seeking a journalist to cover Wall Street banks and serve as a team leader overseeing our coverage of the industry as it moves from a period of restructuring and regulation to a time when business is booming again. Tax reforms engineered by the Trump administration have boosted the bottom line and spurred a spate of megadeals. Meanwhile, trading – once left for dead – has been buoyed by rising interest rates and global economic growth. Other areas like wealth management and asset management are flourishing as banks rely more on technology to keep costs contained.

However, boom times can come with excesses: more risk-taking, questionable products, bigger pay packages and lax oversight. The successful applicant will demonstrate a knack for conceptualizing and delivering stories that explain what’s happening inside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other large financial institutions, and how their actions affect clients, investors, taxpayers and consumers. The team leader would also collaborate with colleagues covering other banks and M&A to break news and drive deeper stories.

Responsibilities:
Pursue ambitious stories, including investigations, about Wall Street banks and their top executives
Break and handle major news about Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
Develop sources across the broader industry, including investment bankers and traders at other big banks
Collaborate with colleagues throughout the Americas, and counterparts in Asia and EMEA, to tell global stories
Be familiar with multiple story-telling platforms including photos, video, text and social media
Requirements:
At least five years’ experience covering financial services firms or corporations
Proven track record of delivering scoops and insightful, agenda-setting stories
Ability to generate and articulate ideas to drive the file forward in original ways
Ability to partner well with different teams, across news bureaus and beats
An interest in editing stories and developing leadership skills
At Thomson Reuters, we believe what we do matters. We are passionate about our work, inspired by the impact it has on our business and our customers. As a team, we believe in winning as one - collaborating to reach shared goals, and developing through challenging and meaningful experiences. With more than 45,000 employees in more than 100 countries, we work flexibly across boundaries and realize innovations that help shape industries around the world. Making this happen is a dynamic, evolving process, and we count on each employee to be a catalyst in driving our performance - and their own.

As a global business, we rely on diversity of culture and thought to deliver on our goals. To ensure we can do that, we seek talented, qualified employees in all our operations around the world regardless of race, color, sex/gender, including pregnancy, gender identity and expression, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, citizen status, veteran status, or any other protected classification under country or local law. Thomson Reuters is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer providing a drug-free workplace.
Intrigued by a challenge as large and fascinating as the world itself? Come join us.

This reporter will be a self-starter who explores news and trends in cruising, air travel, hotels and attractions as they relate to the South Florida market.
S/he breaks news related to local companies and local interests, with an emphasis on stories that affect consumers. On this fast-paced beat, this requires staying abreast of developments by monitoring releases, social media and Google alerts, and posting online quickly to capitalize on digital traffic.
The ability to develop balanced working relationship and sources both within and outside major companies is essential. Through sources, local companies, trade organizations, data and government reports, this reporter also identifies trends relevant to local workers and employers, and examines those in enterprise stories that delve beneath the surface and beyond the predictable.
Among the questions s/he will ask:
What new and/or changing consumer offerings are available to South Floridians in terms of cruising, hotels, attractions and flights? How do those fit within a broader context of travel offerings? How might they affect the local economy or tourism industry?
How do hotels, cruise lines, airlines and attractions positively and negatively impact local wages, jobs and economy?
What conditions, government policies and practices affect worker and guest safety and comfort?
This beat requires a demonstrated commitment to fairness and accuracy, in fact and in tone, and a strong grounding in journalism ethics. And like all journalists at the Herald, this reporter must demonstrate the desire and skills to build audience loyalty, engagement and growth around compelling public service journalism.
This reporter is expected to not only have the ability to build sources and ferret out facts, but frame, write, produce and promote a story via search and social media to ensure that it reaches and resonates with our readers.
The successful candidate must show competency with analyzing data and working with social media tools like CrowdTangle in prospecting for stories.
Essential qualities include flexibility and a demonstrated commitment to constantly adapting to the ever-evolving ways in which readers seek out and interact with journalism. Like all reporters at the Miami Herald, this one will regularly engage with her/his editor to evaluate stories based on audience and mission to determine what is, and isn’t, worth pursuing.
 On audience:
Who cares about this (or who should)?
Is this a big enough group to make the idea worth pursuing the way it is framed?
Is there a way to extend/expand interest in this subject or information to make the group big enough?
If the group is small, is it influential enough to allow the story to have significant impact?
On mission:
Will the story break news that holds leaders or institutions accountable?
Will the story break news that makes a concrete difference in the community?
Will the story tell readers how something will directly affect their lives or the lives of their families or friends?
Will the story use extraordinary, revelatory story-telling to help readers understand a consequential societal issue in new ways?
Will the story (or sometimes a series of quick hits in the cases of breaking news) attract an extraordinary amount of readership or engagement because it is of great interest and/or value to our readers for other reasons?
Pluses include familiarity with the local region, personal or professional travel and/or cruise experience, data-reporting skills and Spanish-language skills.
This position reports to Business Editor Jane Wooldridge.
Minimum requirements:
Strong writing and reporting skills and excellent news judgment
Unwavering commitment to accurate, ethical journalism
Demonstrated ability to use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to reach audiences
Fluency in the science of readership and engagement, including an understanding of how to use analytics
A demonstrated ability to tell stories using a variety of tools and platforms, including photos and video
A demonstrated ability to learn new skills and technologies, including emerging storytelling tools and platforms
